// A linked list node
struct node
{
  int data;
  struct node *next;
};
 
a node can be added in three ways;
1)at the front of the linked list
2)after a given node
3)at the end of the linked list

1)insert from the front
/* Given a reference (pointer to pointer) to the head of a list
   and an int,  inserts a new node on the front of the list. */
void push(struct node** head_ref, int new_data)
{
    /* 1. allocate node */
    struct node* new_node = (struct node*) malloc(sizeof(struct node));
  
    /* 2. put in the data  */
    new_node->data  = new_data;
  
    /* 3. Make next of new node as head */
    new_node->next = (*head_ref);
  
    /* 4. move the head to point to the new node */
    (*head_ref)    = new_node;
}

time complexity: O(1) as it does constant amount of work

2)add a node after a given node:(5 steps)
/* Given a node prev_node, insert a new node after the given
   prev_node */
void insertAfter(struct node* prev_node, int new_data)
{
    /*1. check if the given prev_node is NULL */
    if (prev_node == NULL) 
    { 
       printf("the given previous node cannot be NULL");       
       return;  
    }  
          
    /* 2. allocate new node */
    struct node* new_node =(struct node*) malloc(sizeof(struct node));
  
    /* 3. put in the data  */
    new_node->data  = new_data;
  
    /* 4. Make next of new node as next of prev_node */
    new_node->next = prev_node->next; 
  
    /* 5. move the next of prev_node as new_node */
    prev_node->next = new_node;
}

void insertNode(int position, int new_Data)
{
	struct newNode = (struct node*) malloc(sizeof(struct node));
	newNode->data = new_Data;
	for (int i=0; i<position; i++){
		Node *temp=head;
		temp=temp->next;
	}
	newNode->next=temp->next;
	temp->next=newNode;
}
Time complexity: O(1)as it does constant amount of work

3) Add to the end
/* Given a reference (pointer to pointer) to the head
   of a list and an int, appends a new node at the end  */
void append(struct node** head_ref, int new_data)
{
    /* 1. allocate node */
    struct node* new_node = (struct node*) malloc(sizeof(struct node));
 
    struct node *last = *head_ref;  /* used in step 5*/
  
    /* 2. put in the data  */
    new_node->data  = new_data;
 
    /* 3. This new node is going to be the last node, so make next 
          of it as NULL*/
    new_node->next = NULL;
 
    /* 4. If the Linked List is empty, then make the new node as head */
    if (*head_ref == NULL)
    {
       *head_ref = new_node;
       return;
    }  
      
    /* 5. Else traverse till the last node */
    while (last->next != NULL)
        last = last->next;
  
    /* 6. Change the next of last node */
    last->next = new_node;
    return;    
}
Time Complexity is O(n)where n is the numver of nodes in linked list. Since 
there is a loop from head to end, the function does O(n)work.

Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the 
next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. Greedy algorithms are used for optimization problems. 
An optimization problem can be solved using Greedy if the problem has the following property: 
At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment, and we get the optimal solution of the complete problem.
If a Greedy Algorithm can solve a problem, then it generally becomes the best method to solve that problem as the 
Greedy algorithms are in general more efficient than other techniques like Dynamic Programming. But Greedy algorithms 
cannot always be applied. For example, Fractional Knapsack problem (See this) can be solved using Greedy, but 0-1 Knapsack 
cannot be solved using Greedy.

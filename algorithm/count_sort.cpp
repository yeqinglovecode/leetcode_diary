For simplicity, consider the data in the range 0 to 9. 
Input data: 1, 4, 1, 2, 7, 5, 2
  1) Take a count array to store the count of each unique object.
  Index:     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
  Count:     0  2  2  0   1  1  0  1  0  0

  2) Modify the count array such that each element at each index 
  stores the sum of previous counts. 
  Index:     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
  Count:     0  2  4  4  5  6  6  7  7  7

The modified count array indicates the position of each object in 
the output sequence.
 
  3) Output each object from the input sequence followed by 
  decreasing its count by 1.
  Process the input data: 1, 4, 1, 2, 7, 5, 2. Position of 1 is 2.
  Put data 1 at index 2 in output. Decrease count by 1 to place 
  next data 1 at an index 1 smaller than this index.
 //真的不懂， 这到底是什么原理啊， 而且输出的结果是错的啊（逐位减1话）
  // C Program for counting sort
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#define RANGE 255
 
// The main function that sort the given string str in alphabatical order
void countSort(char *str)
{
    // The output character array that will have sorted str
    char output[strlen(str)];
 
    // Create a count array to store count of inidividul characters and
    // initialize count array as 0
    int count[RANGE + 1], i;
    memset(count, 0, sizeof(count));
 
    // Store count of each character
    for(i = 0; str[i]; ++i)
        ++count[str[i]];
 
    // Change count[i] so that count[i] now contains actual position of
    // this character in output array
    for (i = 1; i <= RANGE; ++i)
        count[i] += count[i-1];
 
    // Build the output character array
    for (i = 0; str[i]; ++i)
    {
        output[count[str[i]]-1] = str[i];
        --count[str[i]];
    }
 
    // Copy the output array to str, so that str now
    // contains sorted characters
    for (i = 0; str[i]; ++i)
        str[i] = output[i];
}
 
// Driver program to test above function
int main()
{
    char str[] = "geeksforgeeks";//"applepp";
 
    countSort(str);
 
    printf("Sorted string is %s\n", str);
    return 0;
}


Time Complexity: O(n+k) where n is the number of elements in input array and k is the range of input.
Auxiliary Space: O(n+k)

Points to be noted:
1. Counting sort is efficient if the range of input data is not significantly greater than the number of objects to be sorted. Consider the situation where the input sequence is between range 1 to 10K and the data is 10, 5, 10K, 5K.
2. It is not a comparison based sorting. It running time complexity is O(n) with space proportional to the range of data.
3. It is often used as a sub-routine to another sorting algorithm like radix sort.
4. Counting sort uses a partial hashing to count the occurrence of the data object in O(1).
5. Counting sort can be extended to work for negative inputs also.
